        <p class="img-desc">Mm-wave test bench showing over-the-air transmission and reception between a 1x4 mm-
          wave antenna array to a 2- 4x4 antenna mm-wave antenna array.
          This setup describes a mutual coupling effect between a transmitting 4x4 antenna array coupling its
          radiated energy to a nearby receiving 4x4 antenna array while another 1x4 antenna array transmits to
          the receiving 4x4 antenna array. The antenna arrays connect to a USRP device through a 2-channel BBox
          devices and Up-Down Converter (UD Box). The setup enable a scenario where Full-Duplex
          communication can be achieved where a transceiver with separate TX and RX mm-wave antenna array
          could be transmitting and receiving (from a different TX) at same time and on same Frequency band
          while estimating the amount of coupling at the antenna Front-end.</p>

        <p class="img-desc">A Mm-wave test bench sowing a transmission and reception of mm-wave signal with received
          signal shown on LTE Application Framework.The set-up describes a USRP transmitting a 2GHz RF signal to UDBox (up-down converter) on the right. The UDBox converts received signal to mm-wave signal at 28GHz. The mm-wave signal propagates over the air through the 4x4 antenna array connected to the BBox. The received signal which goes through
          the BBox to the UDBox and finally to USRP is viewed through LTE Application Framework on the
          Computer monitor. The LTE application Framework indicates the received signal power spectrum level,
          its constellation, data rate, throughput of received signal and signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

        <p class="img-desc">Mm-Wave test bench showing connection between USPR device to 2 Up-Down Converters
          (UD-Box) and 2 BBOx/antenna array devices via RF coax cable.
          The set-up which enables the transmission and reception of mm-wave signal using a 4x4 mm-wave
          antenna array can be achieved through -
          The USRP device transmit RF signal to the right UD Box and the signal gets upconverted to mm-wave
          signal. The mm-wave signal is driven to the right BBox device via the high bandwidth coaxial cable. A 4x4
          mm-wave antenna array connected to the BBox propagates the mm-wave signal through the air space
          (channel) to the left BBox device through a 4x4 mm-wave antenna array. The receiving signal gets down-
          converted to RF signal by the Left UD-Box and finally received by the USRP.</p>
